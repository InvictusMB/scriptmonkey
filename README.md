scriptmonkey
============

Introduction
------------
**Script Monkey** breaks the boundaries of Java and helps Java achieve the power & flexibilities of *interpreted/dynamic* languages.
In other words, it helps Java achieve the best of both worlds.

Thanks to the embedded Rhino & Scripting API for being part of Java since v1.6. It's an all-in-one plugin which means, anything that was possible only by writing a plugin can be done using _plugin-scripts_(simple javascript code). And, any tasks that makes more sense to be scripted can be implemented using this tool.

Demos

Instead of explaining what this plugin can do in words, we wanted to show some in action.
